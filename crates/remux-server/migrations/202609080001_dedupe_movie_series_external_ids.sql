-- A check-then-insert race in metadata import let two rows for the same
-- real Movie/Series/TvProgram get created under different UUIDs when they
-- shared an external id (imdb/tmdb/tvdb/kitsu/custom_stremio_id) but arrived
-- concurrently, before either had committed for the other to find. This
-- collapses any such existing duplicates before the next migration adds
-- UNIQUE indexes that make the race impossible going forward — those
-- indexes cannot be created while duplicate data still exists.
--
-- One pass covers all five fields (a loser can match its winner via more
-- than one field at once — that's the common case in practice — and
-- INSERT OR IGNORE just keeps the first mapping found for it). Each of the
-- five per-field lookups already has a matching partial index from an
-- earlier migration (idx_media_ext_imdb/tmdb/tvdb/kitsu/stremio_id), so
-- finding duplicate groups is an index scan, not a table scan; the actual
-- remap/delete steps below are driven by however few duplicate rows this
-- finds (a handful, not a fraction of the table), using the existing
-- indexes on parent_id/grandparent_id/media_relations/user_media_state to
-- locate what references them. If some pathological multi-field chain
-- isn't fully collapsed by this single pass, the next migration's
-- CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fails loudly rather than silently losing data.
